# Virtualoso

A virtual theremin and drum kit. Makes use of an implementation of colour-tracking via a webcam so that a user can make noise.

Coursework project for year 1 "Audio-Visual Computing".

This was a collaboration with [Charlie Ringer](https://github.com/cring002).

## Requirements
* Processing 2 (It may work using Processing 3, but this has not been tested.)
* A webcam
* Any two objects to track (preferably with strong colours)
